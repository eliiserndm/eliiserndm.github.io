<p>Welcome to my very own website. Here you can find out a little more about myself.</p>


<h2>About</h2>

<p>I ammmm a nineteen-year-old girl with high expectations in life and in order 
to achieve my goals I am studying development of IT systems in the best technology 
university in Estonia-  <a href="https://www.ttu.ee">TalTech</a>. Dancing has been 
a big part of my life so I joined the TalTech Cheerleaders´ Showdance group. 
I enjoy making coregraphies. I have various hobbies that also include making others happy. 
I enjoy doing track and field, I have even competed in the Estonian Championships. 
Makeup is one of my passions, making others glow up for an occasion makes them happy 
and warms my heart. Traveling and discovering new places and rich cultures helps me 
get a better grip of the world. I take interest in volunteering and organizing fashion 
shows in my city. I’ve been the leader of the design team of the annual fashion show 
MoeP.A.R.K for 4 years. Also I like modeling and being in front of the camera, that’s 
why I took part in the 2016 Estonian Princess competition. All of that makes me a 
high-reaching, enthusiastic and goal-oriented person with a positive attitude.</p>
