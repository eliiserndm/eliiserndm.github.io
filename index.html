<p><i>Welcome to my very own website. Here you can find out a little more about myself.</i><p>


<h2>About</h2>

<p><i>I am a nineteen-year-old girl with high expectations in life and in order         <br>
to achieve my goals I am studying development of IT systems in the best technology      <br>
university in Estonia-  <a href="https://www.ttu.ee">TalTech</a>. 
<p>Dancing has been a big part of my life so I joined the TalTech Cheerleaders´ <br>
Showdance group.           
I enjoy making coregraphies. I have various hobbies that also include making others     <br>
happy. I enjoy doing track and field, I've even competed in the Estonian Championships. <br> 
Makeup is one of my passions, making others glow up for an occasion makes them happy    <br>
and warms my heart. Traveling and discovering new places and rich cultures helps me     <br>
get a better grip of the world. I take interest in volunteering and organizing fashion  <br> 
shows in my city. I’ve been the leader of the design team of the annual fashion show    <br>
MoeP.A.R.K for 4 years. 
<p>Also I like modeling and being in front of the camera, that’s   <br>
why I took part in the 2016 Estonian Princess competition. Most recently I represented  <br>
Estonia in the Miss Grand International 2019 beauty pageant in Venezuela. All of that   <br>
makes me a high-reaching, enthusiastic and goal-oriented person with a positive attitude.</i><p>
